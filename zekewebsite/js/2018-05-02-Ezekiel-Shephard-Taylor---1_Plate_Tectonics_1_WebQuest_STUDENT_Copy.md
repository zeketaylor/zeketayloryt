**Tectonic Plates Web Quest **

**Introduction**

Almost all of the processes that shape our Earth are affected by what is going on deep under the crust. The formation of volcanoes is evidence that the inside of the Earth is not just solid rock.  The growth of mountains implies immense forces at work to push mountains so high. In fact, the movement of material in the Earth even affects the weather that we have. Many scientists believe that life would not be possible on Earth, if it were not for the activity going on miles beneath our feet.

**Task**

When you finish this web quest you should be able to: 

Explain the theory of plate tectonics, Indicate some of the evidence that supports the Theory of Plate Tectonics, Explain how plate tectonics has shaped the surface of the Earth, Determine what kind of plate boundary is found at a given location, Describe the driving force for plate movement, Explain some of the ways that plate tectonics affect humanity.

**Process**

Use the website links provided and answer the following questions. Each group of questions has a recommended website link to search for the answers. Once you have found an answer, write it in the space provided. 

 

**Recommended link for questions 1-3: ****[Alfred Wegne**r](../../../itcommon/Student/Zahrobsky/6th grade/The Changing Earth Geology/Alfred Wegner)** **[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/do12we.html](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/do12we.html)

1. What evidence did Alfred Wagner use to support his theory of continental drift?

	1.)that the whole earth used to be together.

	2.)if the world miles beyond the ground didn't drift life would not exist.

	3.)DC drifted away 15 ft.

	4.)he discovered the mid  ocean ridge

2. Why do you think people didn't believe continental drift theory when Wagner first explained it?

Because people barely believe anything because people think that they know everything like you can't read minds like how do you know when someone tellin the truth.

3. Who were the scientists that brought forth supporting evidence to Wagner's theory, and what was their evidence?

	1.)Harry Hess

	2.)Arthur Holmes

	1.)

	2.)

	3.)

8. Explain what is an ocean trench?  Where is it found?  How does it form?

9. How old are the rocks off the east coast of North America?   How old are the rocks right along the mid-Atlantic ridge?   What is the relationship?

10. What is a convection current or cell, describe how it works (use a picture if you want)?

11. What are the two main sources of heat inside the Earth?

	1.)

	2.)
